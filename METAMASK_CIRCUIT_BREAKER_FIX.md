# MetaMask Circuit Breaker Error Fix

## What is the Circuit Breaker Error?

The "circuit breaker is open" error occurs when MetaMask has too many failed requests to a network and temporarily blocks further requests to prevent spam or errors.

## How to Fix It

### Method 1: Wait and Retry (Recommended)
1. **Wait 30-60 seconds** - The circuit breaker will automatically reset
2. **Try connecting again** - The app will now automatically retry up to 3 times with 3-second delays
3. **If still failing** - Refresh the page and try again

### Method 2: Reset MetaMask Connection
1. **In MetaMask**: Go to Settings → Advanced → Reset Account
2. **Or**: Disconnect and reconnect your wallet in MetaMask
3. **Refresh the page** and try connecting again

### Method 3: Clear Browser Cache
1. **Clear browser cache** and cookies for the site
2. **Restart your browser**
3. **Try connecting again**

### Method 4: Restart MetaMask
1. **Close MetaMask completely**
2. **Reopen MetaMask**
3. **Try connecting again**

## Prevention Tips

- **Don't spam the connect button** - Wait for each attempt to complete
- **Ensure Hardhat is running** before connecting
- **Use the correct network** (Chain ID: 1337 for local development)

## Current Status

✅ **Hardhat Network**: Running on http://localhost:8545  
✅ **Chain ID**: 1337 (correct)  
✅ **Auto-retry**: Enabled (up to 3 attempts)  
✅ **Error handling**: Enhanced with specific circuit breaker detection  

## If All Else Fails

1. **Restart your computer**
2. **Update MetaMask** to the latest version
3. **Try a different browser**
4. **Check if antivirus/firewall is blocking localhost connections**

The app now automatically detects circuit breaker errors and will retry the connection with helpful error messages.
